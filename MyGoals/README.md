### **Goals for 2025**

Following extensive research into the foundational pillars required for a stable and successful career in the current technological landscape, I have defined a set of strategic goals to be accomplished by the end of 2025.

This roadmap is designed to build a comprehensive and robust skill set, focusing on high-demand areas of computer science.

**Core Learning Objectives:**

1.  **Python for AI/ML:** Achieve proficiency in Python to serve as a gateway to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies.
2.  **C++ for DSA:** Master C++ for the specific purpose of implementing and understanding complex Data Structures and Algorithms.
3.  **Database Management (SQL/MySQL):** Gain expertise in SQL and MySQL, covering essential Database Management System (DBMS) concepts.
4.  **Operating Systems:** Develop a deep, foundational knowledge of OS principles, processes, and architecture.
5.  **Computer Networking:** Acquire a thorough understanding of networking protocols, models, and infrastructure.
6.  **System Design:** Learn the core principles of designing scalable, reliable, and efficient system architectures.

While this agenda is ambitious, I view this pressure as a catalyst for growth and a necessary step to move beyond my comfort zone. This repository will serve as the official record of my progress against these objectives.

I will be updating before 2026 and will be sharing all experience and resources which help me to boil ocean like goals.
